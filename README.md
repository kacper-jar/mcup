# mcup

**mcup** is a command-line tool for quickly creating Minecraft servers.
Inspired by tools like `rustup` and `npm init`, `mcup` simplifies the setup process and allows for templated server creation with support for multiple server types (e.g., vanilla, Spigot).
Made for both advanced server managers and beginners setting up their first server.

## Features

- Fast server setup with a single command
- Template system for custom or reusable server setups
- Locker system for managing supported server versions and download links

downloading and configuring different server flavors.
