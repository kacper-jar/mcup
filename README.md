# mcup

**mcup** is a command-line tool for quickly creating Minecraft servers.
Inspired by tools like `rustup` and `npm init`, `mcup` simplifies the setup process and allows for templated server creation with support for multiple server types (e.g., vanilla, Spigot).
Made for both advanced server managers and beginners setting up their first server.

## Features

- Fast server setup with a single command
- Template system for custom or reusable server setups
- Locker system for managing supported server versions and download links
- Designed for Linux (Also supports Windows and macOS. Flatpak and APT distributions planned)

## Installation

### 📦 Snap (Linux)

Install from the Snap Store:

```sh
sudo snap install mcup
```

Or install from a local `.snap` file:

```sh
sudo snap install --dangerous ./mcup_*.snap
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace `./mcup_*.snap` with the actual path to your downloaded file.

### 🧊 APT / .deb (Linux)

Install via APT repository (if available):

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mcup
```

Or install from a local `.deb` package:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i ./mcup_*.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace `./mcup_*.deb` with the actual path to your downloaded file.

### 🔧 Manual (All platforms)

```

## Usage

Basic usage pattern:

```sh
mcup <command> [options]
```

### Commands

- `server create [path]` – Create a new Minecraft server in the specified path (defaults to current directory)
- `template use <template_name> [path]` – Create a server based on a saved template
- `template create <template_name> ` – Create a new server template
- `template import <path>` – Import a template from a file
- `template export <template_name>` – Export a template to a file
- `template delete <template_name>` – Remove a stored template
- `template list` – List all stored templates
- `template refresh <template_name>` – Update a stored template with new download links from a locker file
- `update` – Update the locker file with the latest server metadata

## Locker System

`mcup` maintains a list of supported server types and versions via a **locker file**, which contains metadata for downloading and configuring different server flavors.

### Locker Files

- `locker.json`: Main file with server data (downloaded from [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kacper-jar/mcup-locker-file))
- `locker-meta.json`: Local file storing `last_updated` to avoid unnecessary downloads

Locker updates check the last commit date on GitHub to determine if a new version should be downloaded.
