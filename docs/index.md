# **mcup**

**mcup** is a command-line tool for quickly creating Minecraft servers.
Inspired by tools like `rustup` and `npm init`, mcup simplifies the setup process and allows for templated server
creation with support for multiple server types (e.g., vanilla, Spigot).
Made for both advanced server managers and beginners setting up their first server.
